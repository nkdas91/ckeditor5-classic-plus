<div id="editor">
    <h2>Mandarin Duck</h2>

	<p>
		The <b><i>Mandarin Duck</i></b> is a perching duck species native to the East Palearctic.
		It is closely related to the North American wood duck.
	</p>

    </figure>

	<p>
		The adult male has a red bill, large white crescent above the eye and reddish face and
		"whiskers". The male's breast is purple with two vertical white bars, and the flanks
		ruddy, and he has two orange "sails" at the back (large feathers that stick up like
		boat sails). The female is similar to the female wood duck, with a white eye-ring and
		stripe running back from the eye, but is paler below, has a small white flank stripe,
		and a pale tip to its bill.
	</p>

	<p>
		Both the males and females have crests, but the purple crest is more pronounced on the male.
